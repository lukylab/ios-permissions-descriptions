# iOS Permissions Descriptions

A collection of sample user-facing descriptions for every permission on iOS. As a developer, I often found myself rewriting Info.plist permission strings and worrying if they were clear enough for users and App Store Review. This repo puts together concrete examples for all the common permissions, so you can ship faster and avoid confusion or rejections.

## Why this exists

As an indie developer with more than 10 apps in the App Store, I know it’s easy to spend too much time thinking about how to word Info.plist descriptions—or to forget some edge cases. App Review can be strict about vague or generic descriptions, and users appreciate clear, honest explanations too.

These samples come from my own apps and research. I’m sharing them here so other developers, especially those working solo or on small teams, can save time and avoid mistakes.

## How to use this

1. Browse the [PERMISSIONS.md](PERMISSIONS.md) file to find the system permission you need.
2. Copy and adapt a sample description for your own app and use-case.
3. If you see anything missing, unclear, or that could be better, please open an issue or pull request—help the next developer, too.
